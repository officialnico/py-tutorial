# Opening files (in python!): üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Why do you want to open a file in python? well a lot of data will come in a file such as the .csv files
this is used to store data and as python programmers we want to manipulate and analyze data so getting the data from this file
into a python variable would extremely useful.

Not only does this allow you to read files, but also to store information in files.
This can allow your program to store information on your drive, unlike variables this data won't be wiped everytime python is closed
therefore this is very useful as there is no other <em>relevant<em/> way of storing data permanently in python.

##The open functions: `open(filename, permission)`

there are only 2 permissions you have to understand

`'r'` permission for reading the file
`'w'` permission for writing the file

let's read a file, this could be **any** type of file (i.e '.txt', '.csv')

first we have to make sure that the file is in the same folder as the script

for this example let's open and get the data from example filename 'numbers.csv'
