# for loops üèî‚òØÔ∏è

they sound scary but for loops are the best thing ever, I'm going to try to convince you

so say you have a list 'a' of any number (or type) of elements

`a = ["elm1", "elm2", "elm3"]`

Try to print every single one of those elements like this

i'll wait üòå

if you notice a problem, you might be onto something because there is one!

You have to cycle through these elements to print them pretty... but how?

Use a for loop! anytime you're asked to cycle through a list for loops are the way to go!

look how easy and efficient this is

```
a = ["elm1", "elm2", "elm3"]

for x in a:
  print(x)
```

output:

#### how `for x in a:` reads:	
"for every element in a `["elm1", "elm2", "elm3"]`
assign one to x and then run the following code `print(x)`, afterwards go to the next element"

(iterate means "to cycle through", we iterate 'over' lists)
