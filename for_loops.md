# for loops üèî‚òØÔ∏è

they sound scary but for loops are the best thing ever, I'm going to try to convince you

so say you have a list 'a' of any number (or type) of elements

`a = ["elm1", "elm2", "elm3"]`

Try to print every single one of those elements like this

i'll wait üòå

if you notice a problem, you might be onto something because there is one XD

You have to cycle through these elements to print them pretty... but how?

```
a = ["elm1", "elm2", "elm3"]

for x in a:
  print(x)
```

how `for x in a` reads:
"for every element in a, assign the current one to x and then run the following code"
+ afterwards we move onto the next element until the list is done

this is why printing x will print the current elem
