# Python Notes 🌁

## How to get arguments from the terminal (command line):

### What are arguments? Arguments are what you passing to functions in the () for example
`print(arg1)`
or more generically
`function(arg1,arg2,arg3)`

### Why do we need to get arguments from the terminal?
  Passing arguments through the command line can be very useful because
  then you don't have to ask the user for input.
  Think about it, do you want to be asked for input everytime? or just put it into the same command that runs the program
  
### Passing arguments through the usual way: 
`x = input("enter number: ")
print(x)'
